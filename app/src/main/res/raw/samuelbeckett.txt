Have you not done tormenting me with your accursed time! It is abominable! When! When! One day, 
is that not enough for you, one day he went dumb, one day I went blind, one day we will go deaf, 
one day we were born, one day we shall die, the same day, the same second, is that not enough for 
you? They give birth astride of a grave, the light gleams an instant, then it is night once more.
