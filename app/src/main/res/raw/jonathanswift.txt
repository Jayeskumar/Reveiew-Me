This made me reflect how vain an attempt it is for a man to endeavor doing himself honor among 
those who are out of all degree of equality or comparison with him. And yet I have seen the 
moral of my own behavior very frequent in England since my return, where a little contemptible 
varlet, without the least title to birth, person, wit, or common sense, shall presume to look 
with importance, and put himself upon a foot with the greatest persons of the kingdom.
